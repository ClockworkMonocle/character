# Starting

*----what i imagine here is a large text box along the top (in something nice a nice gentle blue, oooooh) that will walk you through the process.  each step will have a next and back button to progress/make changes. it would highlight the parts of the tab it is currently walking you through, and when you hit next it’ll bring you to the next text box, highlighting the newly discussed sections, continuing through the tabs until your character is finished. the first part that follows immediately can be on its own little screen, with a “skip intro” button for wily veterans, and a “next” choice to continue. if you hit skip it’ll say something like “Do you really want to skip the character wizard and fill in the sheet alone?” whereas next continues along the progression.*

### [[[create new character (+)]]]
>>>>"Welcome to the new character creator app for D&D 5th edition [name pending]! This app is designed to replace your character sheets for your 5th edition character. Keep in mind, you will still be managing most of your character--i.e. you will still be doing your own rolling and calculating damage, health, etc. (that's half the fun!).  What this app does is 1) gives you an easy-to-use way of managing your character on your mobile devices, 2) automates some of the more tedious number entries, and 3) provides a step-by-step creation guide.  Let's start with building your new character and then introduce you to the app!

*[[[provide a skip intro button that will jump to -------(?)]]]*

### "INFO TAB"
>>Choose Race/Class
>>>>"First things first, who/what is your character?  Input your Race and Class here.  Keep in mind that each Race has abilities that will affect your Class, so pick two that work well together! You can come back later or use "back" to fix any errors."
>>[[[Fill in Race]]], [[[Fill in Class]]]
>>[[[back]]], [[[next]]]
>>Background Info
>>>>"Now name your character and provide some info about him.  Where did s/he come from, what are their strengths/weakness, why are they on this adventure, what kind of person are they?  Put that information here.  Refer to your D&D 5th edition handbook for some examples."
>>[[[Fill in Background]]], [[[Fill in Alignment]]], [[[Fill in Traits]]]
>>[[[back]]], [[[next]]]

>>[[[Fill in Languages]]], [[[Fill in Proficiencies]]]
>>[[[back]]], [[[next]]]

### "ABILITY SCORES TAB"
>>Ability Scores
>>>>"Now roll for your characters starting stats.  Unless otherwise directed by your DM, roll four 6 sided die (4d6) and choose the 3 highest numbers, for a min value of 3 and a max of 18. Repeat this 5 more times to get your 6 stats and choose where to allocate your 6 values.  Refer to your Player Handbook to determine the modifier for each stat and enter these values into the table. Don’t forget to add your ability bonuses based on your Race!”

>>[[[back]]], [[[next]]]
>>Skills
>>>>”For your Skills, the app will will take your relevant ability modifiers and fill them in.  At this point, go through the available Skills and choose those your character will be proficient in.  Choose from the list of skills you can be proficient in based on your Class and Background. In the future, if you should need to make any manual changes to a Skill’s score, you will be able to add modifiers (should they come from equipment, temporary bonuses, etc.).”
>>[[[Select proficient Skills]]]
>>[[[back]]], [[[next]]]

### ”EQUIPMENT”
>>Money
>>>>”The amount of money you have is determined by 1 of 2 things: 1) The Starting Equipment you choose from based on Class and Background OR 2) from the “Starting Wealth by Class” section from the Player Handbook. You would use the total amount of gold you roll for to buy all your equipment, then note the remainder here.  Ask your DM how they want to determine starting gold. 
>>[[[Fill in Money]]]
>>[[[back]]], [[[next]]]
>>Equipment
>>>>”List all the equipment you either started with or purchased here.  You will add to this list as you discover treasure during your travels.  Add a good description of your item, such as damage and and traits (ex. 1d8 slashing weapon), so you don’t need to refer to the Player Handbook to know what your various items can do.”
>>[[[Fill in Equipment]]]
>>[[[back]]], [[[next]]]

---

### ”DEFENSES TAB”
>>Hit Points and Hit Die
>>>>”Your Max Hit Points (HP) is determined by your Class’s Hit Dice and your Constitution Modifier--take the max value of your Hit Dice and add your Con Mod to get your max HP.  Fill in the values for HP and Hit Dice now.  Hit Dice will be spent during short rests to heal, and are regained after long rests.  Update your number of Hit Dice as you level, and track them as you use and regain them along your adventures. HP increases on Level Up by rolling your Hit Dice + Con Mod OR taking the average of your Hit Dice + Con Mod (ex. fighter with 18 Con would roll a d10 + 4 OR take 9).”
>>[[[Fill in Hit Points and Hit Dice]]]
>>[[[back]]], [[[next]]]

---

### Armor Class
>>>>”Armor Class, or AC, determines how hard your character is to hit or injure. Standard AC is 10 + your Dex Mod if you are unarmored, but follows different rules if you wear armor or a shield.  Reference the “Armor and Shields” section of your Player Handbook for specifics on how the armor you purchased affects your AC.  You will also need to look at your Class Feats to see how they affect your AC, such as the Barbarian’s “Unarmored Defense.”
>>[[[Fill in AC]]]
>>[[[back]]], [[[next]]]

---

### Initiative and Speed
>>>>”Initiative is added to your Initiative roll during combat.  Your  base initiative comes from your Dex.  Speed determines how far you can move in a turn during combat, and this stat is based on your Race and any relevant feats your character may have.”
>>[[[Fill in Initiative and Speed]]]
>>[[[back]]], [[[next]]]

---

### Saving Throws
>>>>”Your Savings Throws will be used to save from certain attacks and events during your characters travels.  These values come from your Ability Mods.  Your Class is proficient in certain Saving Throws, refer to the Players Handbook and mark your proficient Saving Throws now.”
>>[[[Select Proficient Saving Throws]]]
>>[[[back]]], [[[next]]]

---

### Death Saves
>>>>”You don’t need to do anything with this now, just remember that it’s here.  If you are ever downed in battle, you will need to save 3 times to get yourself back up.  3 failures means your character has died!  Track your successes and failures here should you ever need them.”
>>[[[back]]], [[[next]]]

---

### ”FEATURES”
>>>>”Here is where you will add the feats your character gains as they level up in their Class--each Class gets certain abilities at certain levels, such as the “Rage” ability Barbarians start with, or the “Magical Secrets” ability Bards get at level 10. Ask your DM if you have the choice to choose from the feats list every 4 levels, those will also go in this section. When adding your Features, put enter a description that will help you remember what it does so you don't need to refer to the Player Handbook all the time. Certain abilities also have “charges” or a number of times they can be used with each long rest.  If that applies to your ability (such as Ki Points for a Monk) note that here, and your charges will show up on the Attacks page that we will visit later.”
>>[[[Fill in Feats]]]
>>[[[back]]], [[[next]]]

---

### ”ATTACKS”
>>Attack Bonus
>>>>”Your Attack Bonus is the modifier you add to your attack rolls and some spells. Roll a d20 when you attack an enemy and add this value, the result vs. their defenses (beit AC or Reflex) will result in a hit or a miss!  Your attack bonus is based on the Ability Modifier of the weapon you are using and whether or not you are proficient in the use of that weapon.  You should have noted the weapons you are proficient in back in the “Proficiencies” section on the “Info” tab.  Choose the modifier your weapon uses, which will draw from your Ability Scores.  Refer to the Equipment section of the Player Handbook to see what values your weapon uses, and whether it is Str, Dex, etc.  If your character casts spells, this is also your Spell Attack Bonus.  Choose the Modified your Class uses to cast its spells, and be sure to check your Proficiency box.”
>>[[[Fill in Attack Bonus]]]
>>[[[back]]], [[[next]]]

### Attacks
>>>>”Here you will list your Attacks as well as a description of what it does. Examples would be “Sneak Attack” for a Rogue and “Flurry of Blows” for Monk. Be sure to note how many enemies it targets, range, damage, anything you’d need to know when using it in battle!”
>>[[[Fill in Attacks]]]
>>[[[back]]], [[[next]]]

---

### ”SPELLS”
>>>>Some Classes have the ability to cast spells.  If yours does not (or at least doesn’t start out with the ability to cast) you can skip this section and your character is done! If not, continue to follow the Character Creation Wizard.”
>>[[[back]]], [[[next]]], [[[FINISH!]]]

---

### Spell Save DC
>>>>”Casters need to know their Spell Save DC.  This value  is needed for certain spells where an enemy needs to roll less than your Spell Save DC value to be affected by your spell.  The value is 8 + your Class’s Casting Mod + your Proficiency Bonus, but the app does all that for you. Just select your Class’s Casting Mod and you’re done!”
>>[[[Fill in Spell Save DC]]]
>>[[[back]]], [[[next]]]

---

### Spells
>>>>”As a caster, you will gain various spells as you level up.  This is where you will reference your spells for use in combat or otherwise.  Enter the name of the spell and a description (including range, damage, duration, etc.) of your spell so you can cast it quickly when needed and be able to know exactly what it does.  You will also need to manage the number of spells you can cast, which is dependent on your Class. Refer to the Spellcasting section of your Player Handbook and your Class section to understand how many spell slots you have available per level.”
>>[[[Fill in Spells]]]
>>[[[back]]], [[[next]]]

---

>>>>”Your character is finished! Hit Finish to exit the Character Creation Wizard and then review all your character info.  You can edit anything you need to after exiting the Wizard, but will no longer have these long text boxes to help and annoy you.  Thanks for using the {name of our app here} and good luck on your adventure!”
>>[[[back]]], [[[FINISH!]]]

# Notes:

  I guess the wizard can either be an overlay that guides you through filling out character stuff, or it can have it’s own inputs, and be a series of questions and not use the character app directly; only ask the player the bare minimum to get up and rolling (remove prompts like: spells, attacks, equipment,  and only focus on ability scores, proficient skills, traits, info, etc).
